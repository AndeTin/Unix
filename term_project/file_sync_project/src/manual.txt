BEGINNER MANUAL: FILE SYNC PROGRAM

STEP 1: PREPARE THE ENVIRONMENT

    Ensure you have sshpass installed if you plan to use password-based authentication. You can install it using: sudo apt-get install sshpass
    
    // sudo apt-get install sshpass
    
    Identify the directories and remote server you want to synchronize:
        Local directory: The directory on your machine to monitor for changes.
        Backup directory: A local directory where backups will be stored.
        Remote directory: A directory on the remote server where files will be synced.

STEP 2: RUN THE PROGRAM

    Open your terminal.
    Run the program with the following command: ./file_sync <local_directory> <remote_user> <remote_ip> <remote_directory> Replace:
        <local_directory> with the path to your local directory.
        <remote_user> with your username on the remote server.
        <remote_ip> with the IP address or hostname of the remote server.
    	<remote_directory> with the path to the remote directory.

    ex: ./file_sync source/ jesse 192.168.19.23 /home/jesse/Desktop/file_sync_project/remote

STEP 3: CHOOSE THE AUTHENTICATION METHOD
    Enter 1 to use password-based authentication.
    Enter 2 to use SSH key-based authentication (default).
    
    If you choose password-based authentication, you will also be asked to:
        Enter your password for the remote server.
        Specify a custom port if needed. Press Enter to use the default port 22.

STEP 4: MONITOR AND SYNC
    
    When a file is created, modified, or deleted in the local directory:
        The changes will be synced to the backup directory.
        The changes will also be synced to the remote directory.
    If no changes are detected for 10 seconds, the program will:
        Sync the remote directory back to the local directory.
        Sync the remote directory back to the backup directory.

STEP 5: EXIT THE PROGRAM

    To stop the program, press CTRL+C in the terminal.

NOTES: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the directories and the remote server.
    Make sure the backup and remote directories exist before running the program. If not, the program will attempt to create them automatically.
    Test the sync operations with a few files to ensure everything is working correctly.

That’s it! The program will handle synchronization automatically, so you can focus on your work.
